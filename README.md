# E-Com Plus Open Cloud Commerce

Open fair-code headless commerce platform: API-first, microservices based, event driven and cloud native.

_Progressively_ based on [E-Com Plus Store API reference](https://developers.e-com.plus/docs/reference/store/).

## Concepts

1. Long tail eCommerce solution;
2. Truly flexible, modular and extensible;
3. Multi-store and i18n ready;
4. Quick and cheap (as possible) serverless setup;
5. Horizontal autoscale with high availability and performance by default;
6. Modern tech stack and first-class dev experience;
7. Easy third-party integrations;
8. Perfect for edge-rendering and [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/).

## System design

- REST API on edge functions with [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and CDN cache 🚀
- Documents on [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore) (Datastore mode, multi-region recommended) ⛰️ 
- Webhooks and internal API events with [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) 🔄
